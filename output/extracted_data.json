Here’s why:Swift SchedulingGet your surgery within 2–4 weeks rather than waiting 12–18 months on an NHS list for standard decompression.Save up to 60%Complete packages from approx. £5,500, covering surgery, MRI, stay, and transfers—compared to £15,000+ in the UK.Minimally Invasive TechAccess advanced endoscopic systems (7mm incisions) often not widely available in standard UK hospitals, which still rely on \"open\" or \"micro\" techniques.Awake Surgery OptionsMany endoscopic procedures can be performed under local anaesthesia with sedation, eliminating the risks of general anaesthetic and speeding up recovery.All-Inclusive CarePrivate ensuite room, meals, English-speaking coordinator, and airport transfers are standard parts of the deal.What happens during Endoscopic Spine Surgery Abroad01234501Initial ConsultationYou share your recent MRI scans and medical details with us. Our neurosurgeons review them to confirm if endoscopic spine surgery is suitable for your condition.02Surgery PlanningA video consultation is arranged with your surgeon to explain the procedure, answer your questions, and plan your treatment before you travel.03Minimally Invasive SurgeryThe surgeon makes a tiny 7–10 mm incision. A dilator gently separates the muscle fibres instead of cutting them, which helps reduce pain and speed up recovery.04Nerve DecompressionAn endoscope provides a clear, magnified view of the spine. Using precise instruments or laser technology, the surgeon removes the disc material or bone pressing on the nerve.05Recovery and DischargeThe incision is closed with a single stitch or medical tape. Most patients walk within a few hours and return to their hotel the same day or the next morning.Get a quote onlineDiscuss your treatment options with our teamNameEmailPhoneWhat procedure are you interested in?Select one...Knee replacementHip replacementMeniscus tearArthroscopyOther Or give us a call on:020 4572 5337Thank you!

Your submission has been received!Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form.Why Choose Laminectomy Surgery AbroadChoosing to have spine surgery abroad is becoming increasingly popular with UK and Irish patients who want faster, more affordable care without compromising on quality. Here’s why:Swift SchedulingHip replacement arranged in 2 – 4 weeks, not 12 months+ on the NHS.Save up to 65 %Full packages cost significantly less versus going privately in the UK.EU-Regulated QualityISO-certified clinics follow strict EU hygiene and safety standards.Trusted SurgeonsGMC-registered consultants with NHS experience perform the surgery.All-Inclusive CarePrivate room for 3 – 5 nights, meals, English-speaking coordinator and airport transfers included.What happens during Laminectomy Surgery Abroad01234501Preparing for SurgeryBefore the operation, you’ll have a detailed consultation with your surgeon and anaesthetist. They’ll review your scans, medical history, and discuss whether spinal or general anaesthesia is best for you. You’ll also be guided through what to expect before, during, and after surgery, so you feel informed and prepared.02Anaesthesia and PositioningOn the day of surgery, anaesthesia is given to ensure you’re comfortable and pain-free. You’ll be carefully positioned to allow safe access to the spine while protecting your joints and nerves throughout the procedure.03The Surgical ProcedureA small incision is made over the affected area of the spine. The surgeon gently removes the lamina (the back part of the vertebra) to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. Precision instruments are used to minimise tissue damage and ensure accuracy.04Closing the Incision and Immediate MonitoringOnce the pressure is relieved, the incision is carefully closed. You’ll be moved to a recovery area where medical staff closely monitor your breathing, pain levels, and vital signs as the anaesthesia wears off.05Early Recovery and MobilisationMost patients are encouraged to stand and begin walking, with support, within 24 hours. Physiotherapists help you move safely and comfortably. Early mobilisation improves circulation, supports healing, and reduces the risk of complications such as blood clots.Get a quote onlineDiscuss your treatment options with our teamNameEmailPhoneWhat procedure are you interested in?Sel..."
